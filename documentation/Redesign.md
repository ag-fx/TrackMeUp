# Mission

## Issue
As I am mostly using this application to practise working with different front-end,
I want to have a design that allows me to focuss on either the front-end, back-end or domain logic
without having changes radiate across multiple levels.

## Context of exercise
I have read a few books on architecture and design, and am currently reading the DDD book by *Scott Millet*.
This design approach seems to focus on splitting the *core logic* from the *non-core logic* and claims to provide ways
to make an application resistant to both domain changes as well as technology changes.

## Personal remarks
Approaches like these usually sound very good in theory, but my practical experience shows me that
apply these design frameworks too rigorously end up overcomplicating what in essence is a very simple application (such as this).
However, since this project was started as a way to play with different technological solutions, it seems like a good candidate to 
verify the claims made in the book.

**I want to see if I actually end up feeling more comfortable working in my own codebase, without having the urge to
completely redesign it at every step.**

# Approach

## Apply DDD methodology

* Upfront high-level design of core/non-core domains
  ** starting from interaction with users (which is me, at this point)
* Design the core domains in details
* Spend less attention to non-core domains
  ** Chances are, I am going to neglect or throw them out in the future anyway
* Incremental workflow 
* Keep track of what I am doing, and what my thoughts are, so I learn something
* One man team, so don't go crazy on external tooling
