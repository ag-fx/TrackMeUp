# General application desires

## End-user perspective

* As a working professional, I want an application that allows me to keep track of the tasks and activities 
I need or want to perform. I want a portable application that I can use relatively easily anywhere I go, 
and I want to be able to sync my data without too much trouble and without being stuck to a proprietary 
format. 

* I want to be able to track how much time I spend on each task. Since I am required to give daily reports on
what projects I spend my time on at work, I want to be able to generate daily reports of my activities.
I also want to be able to backtrack and get weekly overviews of what I worked on.

* I want to be able to see these times in a human readable format (hours, minutes, seconds) as well as in some
more exotic formats such are used in various spreadsheets and time-registration software packages.
In essence I want to be able to reason in hours and minutes, while being able to simply convert these to 
excel sheets where some manager decided that we will register time as doubles, and that "0.5 hours" is how you  
write down that you spend 30 minutes on a task.

* If my employer asks me to correct an entry I made in the time-registration format, I'd like to be able to look that up quickly
without jumping through hoops, or have a hour-long meditation session to figure out what I was working on on monday afternoon 2 months ago.

* I'd like to be able to group activities/tasks in a logical way.

* I'd like to be able to create and fill in tasks, based on predefined templates.

* I want to be able to see short to-do lists (both daily, monthly, whatever)

* I want to be able to attach notes to my tasks and keep track of when I made the note


## Technical perspective

* I want to be able to change my mind on how my data is shown, and how the UI looks and feels on a whim without having to recode the entire application

* I want to be as independent as possible from technologies, as I tend to see cool apps that do front-end stuff in a certain way, and want to
emulate that within a few days.
