# Developer log

## Day 1

Spent considerable amounts of time thinking about some up-front stuff, such as
where to host certain functionality. I struggled with Date representation, 
and remembered that this was also an issue when I first implemented the code.
I must have gone from Date to LocalDate a bunch of times.
This time might be different through use of the **MicroType** Pattern on dates.

* the time package has been added, it is a supporting core domain
